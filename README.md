## Dataset Content
* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gyanshashwat1611/housing-prices-data). We created then a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace. 
* Each row represents a record indicating a house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Year Built) and its respective sale price

## Business Requirements
As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximizing the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that

* 1 - Lydia is interested in investigating how the house attributes are correlated with the sales price
* 2 - Lydia is interested to predict the house sales price from her 4 inherited houses


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision to validate it (them) 


## Rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized a ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and its content, either block of information or widgets, like: buttons, checkbox, image, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Eventually, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a give feature (for example, in the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but eventually you needed to use another plot type)
